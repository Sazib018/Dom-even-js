            <p>This article is about darknet websites. For the part of the Internet not accessible by traditional web search engines, see Deep web. For the comic book storyline, see Dark Web (Marvel Comics).</p>

            <p>The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets: overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.[1][2][3][4] Through the dark web, private computer networks.</p>
            
            <p>The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend networks, as well as large, popular networks such as Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals.</p>

            <p>Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.[9] The Tor dark web or onionland[10] uses the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.</p>

            <p>As of December 2020, the number of active Tor sites in .onion was estimated at 76,300 (containing a lot of copies). Of these, 18 000 would have original content.[25]</p>
